### About this project:
This is a angular/ionic frontend that provides different tools to extend the functionality of livestream contents. Currently it has videoplayer, chromecast, chat related tools for kick.com. But this project is not affliated with official Kick in any way.

#### Main Features:
1. Chromecast support for kick livestreams.
2. Rewind and forward for few seconds if possible.
3. Showing chat with built in 7tv and kick emotes.

##### Minor features:
1. Search for any streamer and view if they are currently live or not.
2.  View featured streamers.
3.  Toggle Normal mode and Low Latency mode (default). It is possible to be much lower latency than official kick.com livestream sometimes.

## Updates:
1. Version 0.0.1 with chromecast, video player, chat, streamer search and featured streamers.

2. Version 0.1.0 with airplay support, privacy page added for chrome extension, added popout chat, videos page to support vod, download, cast.
Changed videojs from 8 to 7. Added videojs-airplay and videojs types.
Some css change for forcing dark mode for chat and video.

Future Improvement Plans:
1. CSS or design for chat functionality can be improved.
2. With normal mode, video is usually delayed so a chat delay might be useful.
3. Chromecast support can be added to videos as well. 
4. Support for mobile or whether it can be directly run as Android, ios app as it is built with ionic.
